tunnelmaker change log

-- Version 0.9.7
-- Revert back to checking for dtrack by name, instead of groups.advtrains_track.
-- Groups doesn't work in latest versions of advtrains.
-- Changed left-click digging to steel_pick equivalent instead of wood_pick.

-- Version 0.9.6
-- Delete player's global state when player leaves.

-- Version 0.9.5
-- Add cobble braces for bridges if they would be air.

-- Version 0.9.4
-- Major update to build in support for digging up and down.
-- Digging up and down only supports orthogonal and 45deg directions to match advtrains track.
-- (Note: advtrains track requires at least one horizontal track matching slope before making any turns.)
-- To select updown direction, hold sneak key (shift) while right-clicking tunnelmaker.
-- One click selects up (Yellow 'U' on icon), second click selects down (Yellow 'D' on icon),
-- third click returns back to horizontal (no letter on icon).
-- Updown state can also be reset by rotating to different icon, or moving by some amount (still tuning this).
-- Once updown state is selected, release sneak key and use right-click like normal.
-- After digging, updown state will also be reset to horizontal.
-- Known changes/issues caused by using sneak key:
--   • Can't dig up or down while flying.
--   • Digall won't apply its function when right-clicking tunnelmaker.
--   • Can't sneak right-click on ATC track to dig below them.

-- Version 0.9.3
-- Tweak cdir == 2 (nw) digging pattern.
-- Clean up some old debug statements.

-- Version 0.9.2
-- Continue work making tunnelmaker play nice with advtrains track.
-- Per Orwell's request, changed method for determining if node is advtrains track.
-- Instead of searching for dtrack in name of node,
-- I check whether the node belongs to the advtrains_track group using:
--     if minetest.registered_nodes[name].groups.advtrains_track == 1 then
--
-- Note that one can't right click ATC track with tunnelmaker, that track overrides right click.
-- Trying to right click on slope track probably won't do what is wanted.  Right now it treats
-- it like any other track, and digs the ground level.

-- Version 0.9.1
-- 1. Try to play nicer with already placed advtrains track (dtrack*).
--   A. Don't dig dtrack nodes.
--      This allows expanding or extending tunnels where track has already been laid.
--    However this causes issues when using tunnelmaker to raise or lower track.
--      Trying to dig tunnel one node above track won't fill where placed track exists.
--      Trying to dig tunnel one node below track will cause existing track to drop.
--   B. If pointing to dtrack node, assume user actually wants to point to ground below track.
--      Lower positions of pointed_thing by one node, while keeping name the same.
--      This assumes that existing track is sitting on valid node.
-- 2. Restruction direction code to make it much shorter.
-- 3. Fixed bug in implementation of SSW digging pattern.
--
-- Version 0.9.0
-- 1. Updated digging patterns to fix minor irregularities.
-- 2. Added protections for tunneling in water.
--      Adds glass walls around tunnel whenever there is water.
--      Adds glass endcap at end to protect from flooding while tunneling.
--      Note that this can place undesired glass when digging next to ground-level water. This
--        won't happen as long as you're one node higher than the water.
-- 3. Restructured code again.  Code is longer, but simpler to understand.

-- Version 0.8.1
-- Test if air before digging.  Cleans up air not diggable INFO messages.
-- Added test for desert-type biomes, which lets me start using biome-appropriate fill.
--   needs minetest 0.5.0+ to correctly flag desert biomes
--   however, if api doesn't exist (using 0.4.x), test just always returns false

-- Version 0.8.0
-- Changed from dig_node to node_dig (based on what matyilona200 did for the Tunneltest mod)
-- Places only a single instance of each type of block dug in inventory
-- Doesn't cause blocks to drop in 0.5.0-dev
-- Works with digall mod, but make sure it's deactivated before tunneling!

-- Version 0.7.0
-- Added test for fallable blocks in ceiling and replace them with cobblestone.
-- Fixed bug where I was digging from lower blocks to higher blocks.
-- Simplified and cleaned up tunneling code.

-- Version 0.6.0
-- Increased width and height of tunnel created.
